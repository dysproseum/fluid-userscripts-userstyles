# Fluid Userscripts and Userstyles

This is a repo for userscripts and userstyles for the [Fluid](http://fluidapp.com/) app, adding native OS X notifications.


## Usage

1. In your Fluid app, open Window > Userscripts
1. Create a new script (left column plus sign), name it (ex. "Hangouts")
1. Add the URL pattern from the top of the file and enable: (ex. `*hangouts.google.com*`)
1. Paste the contents of `userscript.js` into the text area
1. Reload the window and enjoy!
1. Repeat the process to add Userscripts from the `userstyle.css`

*First time making a Fluid app for Hangouts?*

You'll need to change your User Agent to Chrome.

1. Select the Fluid  menu (right of the Apple logo)
1. Select "User Agent" > "Google Chrome (##) &mdash; Mac"
